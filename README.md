# Hey, I'm nulli83

IT student who builds stuff to understand how it actually works. Currently obsessed with threat intelligence and security systems.

## What I'm up to

Building my own CTI system from scratch because I want to understand every piece of how malicious URL detection actually works. Not interested in just using existing tools - I learn by building.

**Current project:** ML-based malicious URL detector
- Training on 12k+ URLs 
- 21 structural features + 300 TF-IDF features
- Ensemble approach with Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, and statistical analysis
- Actually works pretty well for detecting suspicious stuff

## Skills

- Python (main language for everything)
- Machine learning for security applications
- URL analysis and feature extraction
- Building detection systems
- Chess (helps with thinking ahead and pattern recognition)

## Background

Studying IT with focus on computer science and cybersecurity. I improve systems by understanding them completely, not just using them. 

## Current focus

Working on that CTI platform - want to build something that can actually detect and analyze threats in real time. It's taking forever to train but that's the fun part.

## Contact

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about security, ML, or building stuff.
